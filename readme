# Port Scanner
***Port Scanner*** is a simple tool to help you find open ports associated with a certain host.

## 1. Requirements
* Python 3
* Command line or terminal

## 2. Usage
`python portscanner.py [ip_address] {min_range:max_range}`

If you've executed the `move_to_bin.sh` file, you can also use the port scanner like this:
`portscanner [ip_address] {min_range:max_range}`

## 3. Known issues
* UDP port detection is not working properly (all UDP ports are marked as open)
